      <description>Introduction to Commands In our lives, it is pretty common for us to give commands to others. I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with these two daily ones: &amp;ldquo;Take your test&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Turn in your homework.&amp;rdquo; Commands are able to influence the actions of others, which sets the course for a very important linguistic ability.
